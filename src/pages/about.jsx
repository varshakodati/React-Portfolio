        <p>
         I’m a React developer with hands-on experience in building reusable UI components,
        API integrations, and responsive web applications. 
        I currently work on enterprise applications, gaining exposure to large-scale systems and 
        collaborative development environments. I’m passionate about learning modern frontend
         technologies and improving code quality, performance, and user experience.
